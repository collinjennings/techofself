## A Mechanical Library 
Vannevar Bush first introduced his idea of the memex (which is a portmanteau of [index][locke_index] and [memory] [memory_palace]) in his 1937 essay "As We May Know." His description of the Memex preserves features of print media (with two screens that approximate the view of two pages) while introducing earlier components of electronic computers (observed in the magnetic tape that recorded connections between different sources).
