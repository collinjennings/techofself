In the reading for Monday, Norbert Wiener posits his theory of **cybernetics**, which he defines as "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine." Cybernetics is about *feedback loops*, a concept that is important across a range of fields. Here's an explanation of feedback loops in relation to human behavior: 

> A feedback loop involves four distinct stages. First comes the data: A behavior must be measured, captured, and stored. This is the evidence stage. Second, the information must be relayed to the individual, not in the raw-data form in which it was captured but in a context that makes it emotionally resonant. This is the relevance stage. But even compelling information is useless if we donâ€™t know what to make of it, so we need a third stage: consequence. The information must illuminate one or more paths ahead. And finally, the fourth stage: action. There must be a clear moment when the individual can recalibrate a behavior, make a choice, and act. Then that action is measured, and the feedback loop can run once more, every action stimulating new behaviors that inch us closer to our goals. (Thomas Goetz, [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/ff_feedbackloop/), 6/19/2011)

In your reading, don't worry about the math at the beginning of the chapter or the technical scientific concepts. Focus instead on the analogy that Wiener develops between the computer and the human brain. He argues that both have the capability to learn through feedback loops. After explaining Pavlov's work on understanding conditioned reflexes in animals and humans, Wiener claims "**There is nothing in the nature of the computing machine which forbids it to show conditioned reflexes.**" Wiener wrote this in 1948, and in doing so he helped begin a revolution in imagining learning machines that we now see in artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

**What do you think is at stake in exploring an analogy between the computer and the human brain? How does comparing these things change how we think about each one?**

*Here's an example of a feedback loop in the regulation of body temperature:*
