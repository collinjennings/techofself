When Thad stumbled upon the idea in the 1980s, the possibilities of technology were greater than at any previous moment in history. However, in this essay, I argue that the difference between Thad's moment and earlier ones had as much to do with the cultural imagination of his period as the technological capabilities. While the problem he confronted had previously recurred throughout history, his solution of a wearable computer was prompted by  

*These guys look the same, right?*
