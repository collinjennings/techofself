Thad Starner recounts first wanting the aid of a wearable device when, as a child, he realized that his dad had completely forgotten trigonometry. He knew it once, but when yong Thad needed help on his homework, his dad couldn't help him. This discovery sparked an idea that numerous writers and thinkers have had throughout history, but for Thad this idea appeared at a moment in which it could be acted upon in a radically new way. The idea was, what if I created a tool that would enable me never to forget? It recalled the [memory palaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) of ancient Greece, the [commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) of early modern Europe, and Vannevar Bush's [Memex machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) of mid 20th century.

When Thad stumbled upon the idea of limitless memory in the 1980s, the possibilities of technology were greater than at any previous moment in history. However, in this essay, I argue that the difference between Thad's moment and earlier ones had as much to do with the cultural imagination of his period as the technological capabilities. While the problem he confronted had previously recurred throughout history, his solution of a wearable computer was prompted by theories and representations of cyborgs in the culture.  

*These guys look the same, right?*

Thad remarks that the idea for his first wearable computer came when he saw *Terminator 2* in the early nineties. The Terminator movies indexed a broader conversation about the potential affordances and pitfalls of cyborgs, ranging from Donna Haraway's feminist theory of the cyborg to earlier movies like *Blade Runner*.


*The term **cyborg** first became popular in the English lexicon in the 1980s.*

**Where would this essay go next?** 
- I would research Thad's specific innovations in producing early wearable computers. How did he conceive of the relationship between the body and the machine? In what ways did his wearable computer change and improve over the years? 
- I would situate Thad's work within the broader cultural and technological context of theories and representations of cyborgs.
