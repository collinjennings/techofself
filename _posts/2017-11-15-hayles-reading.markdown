N. Katherine Hayles's piece is different from most the ones we've read. It's written for an audience of educators, and it addresses the topic of how digital media is changing our reading habits. Hayles is interested in practical approaches that teachers and students can take for developing skills for different kind of reading occasions. Reading on the internet entails a different approach than reading print media. Similarly, the algorithms behind search engines and recommendations generated by Amazon and news media sites perform a distinctive kind of reading that often supports human reading processes. As your reading the piece, **think about how you read different textual media differently** -- that is, how you read print materials vs. how you read online. Also, consider Hayles's discussion of different modes of reading in relation to how reading is depicted in *Super Sad True Love Story*. Reading is significant part of Lenny's identity, and it largely alienates him from the broader culture of the novel. **What role do you think reading (or its absence) plays in the novel?**
