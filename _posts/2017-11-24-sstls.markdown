In the section of Super Sad True Love Story that we’re reading for Monday, Lenny and Eunice go over to Joshie’s apartment. Joshie, Lenny’s boss at Post-Human Services, is in his 70s but looks like he’s in his early 30s. When they are in Joshie’s apartment, Lenny observes his old science fiction movie posters, which represent early signs of his obsessive quest for immortality (217). Lenny also sees Joshie admiring Eunice’s youth in a vampiric kind of way. In the second half of the novel, the relationship between these three characters develops into a kind of love triangle. As your reading, consider how Lenny relates to Joshie and Eunice, and think about how Joshie and Eunice relate to each other. How do these different relationships reveal how Lenny doesn’t fit in with the contemporary digital culture of the novel? 

*The movie poster for Logan's Run, which Joshie has framed in his apartment.*
