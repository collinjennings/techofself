## Archictecture of the Mind
In classical and early modern rhetoric, the idea of the memory palace refers to a technique of improving one's memory by [associating] [bush] ideas with locations in a physical space. Even today [memory experts] [thad] often use this architectural method: 
{% include mem_palace.html %} 
The memory palace thus represents a relic of historical cultures that placed a greater emphasis on oral performance that has been carried into the present.
