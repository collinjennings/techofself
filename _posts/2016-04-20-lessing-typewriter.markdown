## The Medium of Expression
In *The Golden Notebook*, [Doris Lessing] [lessing] represents Anna's attempt to represent her trues experiences as mediated through writing in a set of notebooks, but Lessing composed her fiction exclusively on the typewriter. Indeed, in a typewritten letter, we see her practicing a kind of narration similar to Anna's:
> A certain portion of my day is spent on being a good wife and mother. I housekeep, cook, and bring up my baby, who is entirely satisfactory and (how does he manage it?) a most well-balanced and cheerful infant. I spend a portion of my day writing. Increasingly better. I shall be a good writer yet. No one can say this adds up to any sort of harmonious whole, but what can one do? I feel constantly as if I were being torn into shreds with strain. (Lessing, 9/28/1948)
