**writing** - "coded system of visible marks...whereby a writer could determine the exact words that the reader would generate from the text" (Ong, 83). 

**grapholect** - "a national written language...[that has been] isolated from its original dialect base, has discarded certain dialectical forms, and has developed also certain syntactical peculiarities" (Ong, 104)

**epitome vs. commonplace** - summarizing vs excerpting 

**adversaria** - technique of producing a summarized outline 

**storage** - involves sorting according to different methods in different media. 

**print culture** - embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of visual communication. These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture. The development of printing, like the development of writing itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_culture)



## Practical 

**virtual machine** – an emulation of a computer system. It’s based on computer architectures and provides the functionality of a physical computer. It’s like you’re on another computer within our actual, physical one. 

**plain text** - as distinguished from formatted text, it only includes characters (the text) without any style information. 
**Markdown** – a formatting language, like HTML but much simpler.

**static website** – Website generated from static HTML and Markdown files, rather than being generated by a web application from a database. 

**jekyll** – Open-source software for generating static websites. 

**nano** - A text editor that we can use to edit markdown files that will become part of our websites. For basic information about using nano, go [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide).
