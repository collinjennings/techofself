Here are the key terms that we're collecting throughout the semester: 

## Theoretical 

**technology** - "not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness" (Ong, "Writing Restructures Consciousness", 81). 

**communication** -  act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules *via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication)*.

**writing** - "coded system of visible marks...whereby a writer could determine the exact words that the reader would generate from the text" (Ong, 83). 

**grapholect** - "a national written language...[that has been] isolated from its original dialect base, has discarded certain dialectical forms, and has developed also certain syntactical peculiarities" (Ong, 104)

## Practical 

**virtual machine** – an emulation of a computer system. It’s based on computer architectures and provides the functionality of a physical computer. It’s like you’re on another computer within our actual, physical one. 

**plain text** - as distinguished from formatted text, it only includes characters (the text) without any style information. 
**Markdown** – a formatting language, like HTML but much simpler.

**static website** – Website generated from static HTML and Markdown files, rather than being generated by a web application from a database. 

**jekyll** – Open-source software for generating static websites. 

**nano** - A text editor that we can use to edit markdown files that will become part of our websites. For basic information about using nano, go [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide).
