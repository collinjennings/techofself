**writing** - "coded system of visible marks...whereby a writer could determine the exact words that the reader would generate from the text" (Ong, 83). 

**grapholect** - "a national written language...[that has been] isolated from its original dialect base, has discarded certain dialectical forms, and has developed also certain syntactical peculiarities" (Ong, 104)

**epitome vs. commonplace** - summarizing vs excerpting 

**adversaria** - technique of producing a summarized outline 

**storage** - involves sorting according to different methods in different media. 

**print culture** - embodies all forms of printed text and other printed forms of visual communication. These views are related as the printing press brought a vast rise in literacy, so that one of its effects was simply the great expansion of written culture at the expense of oral culture. The development of printing, like the development of writing itself, had profound effects on human societies and knowledge. "Print culture" refers to the cultural products of the printing transformation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_culture)

**technonological determinism** -  reductionist theory that assumes that a society's technology determines the development of its social structure and cultural values. The term is believed to have originated from Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism)

**close reading** - the detailed analysis of the complex interrelations and ambiguities (multiple meanings) of the verbal and figurative components
within a work. M. H. Abrams, [A Glossary of Literary Terms](http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref../abrams_mh.pdf), 7th ed. (Cornell: 1999), 181. 

**affordance** - describes the potential uses or actions latent in materials and designs. 


## Practical 

**virtual machine** – an emulation of a computer system. It’s based on computer architectures and provides the functionality of a physical computer. It’s like you’re on another computer within our actual, physical one. 

**plain text** - as distinguished from formatted text, it only includes characters (the text) without any style information. 
**Markdown** – a formatting language, like HTML but much simpler.

**static website** – Website generated from static HTML and Markdown files, rather than being generated by a web application from a database. 

**jekyll** – Open-source software for generating static websites. 

**nano** - A text editor that we can use to edit markdown files that will become part of our websites. For basic information about using nano, go [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nano/Basics_Guide).

**hypertext** - text displayed on a computer display or other electronic devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately access, or where text can be revealed progressively at multiple levels of detail. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)
